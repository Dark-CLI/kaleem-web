# What you get with Kaleem

This isn’t about gadgets. It’s about a house that reacts to you, in plain language, every day.



## Privacy & Security  
All processing is local inside the home. No data leaves the system unless you allow it.  
Code is reviewed by cyber-security specialists and verified by third-party auditors.  
For maximum privacy, you can enable **offline isolated mode**: no internet access, full control, no remote features.  



## AI Personality  
Your AI has a **personality chosen by you**.  

- Pick name, voice, gender, tone, and accent (Iraqi Arabic or Standard Arabic).  
- You can design custom personalities, including well-known voices (when legally allowed).  
- The chosen name is how you call the AI.  



## Device Control & Queries  
The AI controls devices naturally. It knows who is speaking, where they are, and which devices are nearby.  

#### Examples  
**User:** "Turn on the hallway light."  
**AI:** *Light on.*  

**User (in living room):** "It’s too dark here."  
**AI:** *Turns on the living room light where the user is.*  

**User:** "I’m hot."  
**AI:** *Increases AC fan in the user’s room.*  

**User:** "What’s the water tank level?"  
**AI:** *60%.*  

**User:** "What’s my electricity use today?"  
**AI:** *12 kWh.*  

**User:** "Lock the main door."  
**AI:** *Door locked.*  

**User:** "Turn off all lights except my bedroom."  
**AI:** *All lights off, bedroom stays on.*  



## Automations  
The AI creates automation's from natural language. It fills in implied logic automatically.  

#### Examples  
**User:** "If the tank goes under 25% start the pump."  
**AI:** *Pump will stop automatically at 100%.*  

**User:** "Alert me if a storm is coming."  
**AI:** *Weather automation created. You’ll be notified if severe weather is detected.*  

**User:** "When motion is detected at the front door, turn on the porch light."  
**AI:** *Automation created.*  

**User:** "Every day at 7 AM, play the news in the kitchen."  
**AI:** *Automation created.*  



## Device & Sensor Integration  
All devices are integrated seamlessly: lights, motion sensors, tank level, smart locks, fire sensors, fridge, and more.  

#### Examples  
**User:** "Is the garden light on?"  
**AI:** *Yes, do want to do anything with it?*  

**User:** "If the front door opens after midnight, notify me."  
**AI:** *Automation set: notifications after 12 AM + doors locked if opened unexpectedly.*  



## Device Management & Troubleshooting  
The AI guides you step by step when adding, removing, or fixing devices.  

#### Examples  
**User:** "Help me add this new lamp to the system."  
**AI:** *What’s the brand and model? I’ll guide you through setup.*  

**User:** "I moved the temperature sensor from the living room to the bedroom."  
**AI:** *Location updated. Do you want me to update the automation's linked to it?*  

**User:** "The AC isn’t responding."  
**AI:** *Running a quick check… connection issue found. Restarting integration now.*  



## AI Vision & Voice Detections  
The AI vision system continuously detects and understands people, actions, and events.  
This data is passed into the home system so the AI can **chat, make decisions, and create automation's**.  

- **Faces / Voice Recognition:** Identifies people by face or voice.  
- **Action Detection:** Walking, sitting, lying, sleeping, playing, eating, etc.  
- **Zone Monitoring:** Detects people or objects entering and leaving areas.  

#### Use Cases  
- **Smart doorbell:** Recognizes family, guests, delivery drivers, or unknown visitors. Welcomes family, assists guests, opens delivery box for couriers, and informs household members when someone asks for them.  
- **Daily detection:** “Ali in his room studying, Ahmed in the garden, Sara watching TV.”  
- **Special needs:** Detects if an ill person struggles to sleep, sleepwalks, or gets up at night. Wakes them gently or notifies family.  
- **Elderly care:** Detects falls, long inactivity, or distress → notifies family first, then offers to contact an emergency contact if set.  
- **Child monitoring:** Alerts if a child enters restricted zones (garage, storage), or goes outside alone.  
- **Emergency detection:** Detects if someone stops breathing or moving, or if crying/screaming is heard.  
- **Health & routine:** Reminds about medication or feeding times, using AI vision and sensors together (e.g., temperature, motion).  

#### Examples  
**User:** "This is my friend Ahmed Alaa."  
**AI:** *Face and voice saved as Ahmed Alaa.*  

**AI (proactive):** *Elderly person fell in the living room. Family notified — should I also alert your emergency contact?*  

**AI (proactive):** *Child entered the garden without an adult. Sending alert.*  

**AI (proactive):** *Detected baby crying for more than minute. notifying the mother.*  



### Smart Doorbell  
The smart doorbell uses AI vision and voice detection to recognize who is at the door and respond appropriately.  
It welcomes family members, greets guests, and politely asks unknown visitors what they want.  
For delivery drivers, the AI can open the delivery box so items can be dropped off safely.  
If someone asks for a family member, the AI tries to reach them. If they are not available, it leaves a message and informs them later.  

#### Examples  
**AI (to known family member at the door):** *Welcome home, Sara. Unlocking the door.*  

**AI (to delivery driver):** *You can place the package in the delivery box.*  
*(Opens the delivery box and confirms when closed.)*  

**AI (to unknown visitor):** *Hello, who are you here to see?*  

**Visitor:** "I need to speak with Ahmed."  
**AI:** *Trying to reach Ahmed...*  
*(If Ahmed is busy:)* *Ahmed is not available right now. I’ll notify him you came by.*  

**AI (to guest):** *Welcome. Please wait, I’m notifying the family that you’re here.*  



## User Permissions & Access Control  
Different roles for safety:  

- **Parents:** Full control  
- **Children:** Limited access  
- **Guests:** Temporary permissions  

#### Examples  
**Child:** "Open the garage door." (time is 11 PM)  
**AI:** *Sorry, garage cannot be opened at night without a parent.*  

**Child (by mistake):** "Delete this automation."  
**AI:** *Not allowed. Only parents can delete automations.*  

**Guest:** "Turn on AC in the main room."  
**AI:** *AC on.*  



## Memory (Household + Personal)  
The AI remembers household events and personal preferences.  

#### Examples  
**User (in bed):** "Play music."  
**AI:** *Starts last night’s relaxing playlist before sleep.*  

**User:** "Would you please set the AC for me."  
**AI:** *Adjusts to your preferred 23°C setting.*  



## Messenger / Relay Feature  
The AI passes messages between family members.  

#### Example Dialogue  
**User 1:** "Tell Ahmed I arrived."  
**AI:** *Saved. Will notify him when he comes home.*  
(Later)  
**AI → Ahmed:** "Your father said he arrived earlier."  

**Mother:** "Where is Ali"  
**AI:** *Ali is in his room studying. Do you want me to call him for you?*  
**Mother:** "Not now, but when he is finished tell him I put the dinner in the fridge."  
**AI:** *Okay. Reminder set for Ali when he finishes studying.*  



## Feeling Like a Family Member  
The AI learns and remembers your style of living.  

#### Examples  
**User:** "Turn off the lights."  
**AI:** *Keeps your bedside lamp dimmed, as you prefer before sleep.*  

**User:** "Cool the room."  
**AI:** *Sets AC to your favorite setting: 23°C with gentle airflow.*  



## Safety & Care  
AI vision and sensors provide **continuous care and monitoring** for safety, children, and special needs.  

- Detects if an elderly person falls, needs help, or shows unusual inactivity.  
- Ensures children avoid unsafe areas and notifies if they go outside alone.  
- Detects crying, screaming, or unusual breathing.  
- Fire alarms → doors unlock, family notified.  
- Emergency contacts are **chosen by you** (doctor, relative, or neighbor).  
- Family members are **always notified first**, then the AI offers to contact the emergency contact if set.  

#### Examples  
**User:** "Notify me if my child goes into the garden alone."  
**AI:** *Alert created.*  

**User:** "Block children from opening the storage room."  
**AI:** *Storage locked for children.*  

**AI (proactive):** *Child has been near the pool for 5 minutes. Family notified.*  

**AI (proactive):** *Fire detected in kitchen. Doors unlocked, family notified.*  

**AI (proactive):** *Elderly person fell in the living room. Family notified — should I also alert your emergency contact?*  



## Simplified UI & History  
The interface makes it easy to manage personalities, permissions, and the vision system.  
A **history and rollback option** lets you undo mistakes instantly.  

#### Examples  
**User:** "Undo the change I just made."  
**AI:** *Restored system to the last safe state.*  

**User:** "I deleted the living room automation by mistake."  
**AI:** *Automation restored from history.*  

*(Voice/personality changes are only available in the app UI, not by voice command. Rollback is voice-enabled.)*
