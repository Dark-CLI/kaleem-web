# About Kaleem

The name **Kaleem** reflects the identity of our project.  
It bridges **Arabic language and culture** with the challenges of modern technology. It’s our way of reshaping “AI” into something that belongs here — not imported, but rooted in our region.

For us, the name means making artificial intelligence **close to people**: speaking their language, understanding their habits, and serving their everyday life.  _Kaleem_ is a symbol of our ambition for Iraq and the Arab world to be **creators of the future, not just consumers of it**.

## Our Vision
We believe Iraq can be more than a consumer of imported tech. Our vision is to **develop local talent, create original solutions, and design hardware produced here in Iraq**.

- **Future Hardware Development:** building devices with our brand, locally produced, optimized for Iraqi homes.  
- **Jobs & Talent:** training and supporting the next generation of Iraqi AI and smart home specialists.  
- **Scalable Technology:** everything we build must grow from single apartments to massive housing projects.  


## Principles
- **Exclusive in Iraq:** we are the first company fully dedicated to Iraq’s smart home ecosystem.  
- **Human-Centered Design:** solutions built for families, not just techies.  
- **Scalable Technology:** from one villa to entire complexes.
